## Project Statement

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a deadly degenerative neurological disorder that is the leading cause of dementia in the United States. In severe cases, people with AD have problems recognizing family and friends, learning new things, and carrying out multi-step tasks such as getting dressed. The US Department of Health and Human Services estimates that there may be more than 5.5 million people in the US with AD [1]. In 2016, it was estimated that $277 billion was spent nationwide on Alzheimer's care, along with other forms of dementia [2]. Despite the large population affected by AD, currently, there is no drug or any other intervention that can successfully treat it [1]. As a result, early diagnosis is crucial in dealing with AD.

Longitudinal multicenter investigations, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), are bringing a paradigm shift in the analysis of AD. These studies enable generation of large databases of patients information such as demographics, medical history, lab record, cognitive test score, and imaging data. In this project, based on the ADNI database, we aim to develop a data-driven model to predict AD at early stage and identify the most cost efficient tests to make such predictions.

## Project Goals

The project overarching goal is to predict over time if a patient will develop AD. We are especially concerned about accurate, fast, and inexpensive detection. The goals can be formulated as follows:

1. Based on data at the first visit, predict the progression of the disease
2. Investigate the accuracy of the model as a function of the number of visits
3. Investigate the accuracy of the model as a function of the feature selection
